- Caso o ENUM do campo “type” seja CONTA_PAGAMENTO_PRE_PAGA a estrutura “serviceBundle” fica condicionado caso a instituição tenha pacote de serviço
atrelado a este tipo de conta, porque são contas com serviços essenciais padronizados e regulados pela Resolução BACEN 3919, de 25/11/2010
- Caso o ENUM do campo “type” seja CONTA_DEPOSITO_A_VISTA (conta corrente) ou CONTA_POUPANCA, deverá ser incluso a estrutura “serviceBundle”, porque
existem hoje pacotes passíveis de cobrança diferentes dos serviços essenciais (que não são cobrados)

- Caso o ENUM do campo “type” seja CONTA_PAGAMENTO_PRE_PAGA a estrutura “serviceBundle” fica condicionado caso a instituição tenha pacote de serviço
atrelado a este tipo de conta, porque são contas com serviços essenciais padronizados e regulados pela Resolução BACEN 3919, de 25/11/2010
- Caso o ENUM do campo “type” seja CONTA_DEPOSITO_A_VISTA (conta corrente) ou CONTA_POUPANCA, deverá ser incluso a estrutura “serviceBundle”, porque
existem hoje pacotes passíveis de cobrança diferentes dos serviços essenciais (que não são cobrados)
